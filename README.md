# conan-openssl

[Conan.io](https://conan.io) package for OpenSSL library

The packages generated with this **conanfile** can be found in [this bintray repository](https://bintray.com/conan-community/conan/OpenSSL:conan).

## Build packages

Only necessary if you don't want to use the pre-compiled binaries, and you want to build your own packages from source.

Download conan client from [Conan.io](https://conan.io) and run:

    $ conan test_package
    $ conan test_package # use different settings, options or profiles 
    
## Upload packages to server

    $ conan upload OpenSSL/1.0.2l@lasote/stable --all
    
## Reuse the packages

### Basic setup

    $ conan install OpenSSL/1.0.2l@lasote/stable
    
### Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*
    
    [requires]
    OpenSSL/1.0.2l@lasote/stable

    [options]
    OpenSSL:shared=false # true
    # Take a look for all available options in conanfile.py
    
    [generators]
    txt
    cmake

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    conan install .

Project setup installs the library (and all its dependencies) and generates the files *conanbuildinfo.txt* and *conanbuildinfo.cmake* with all the paths and variables that you need to link with your dependencies.
